/*
Java Implementation of the Accumulator Generator problem
see http://www.paulgraham.com/accgen.html for details

To run this from the command line:

  javac accgen.java && java accgen

Note that I think this kind of violates the spirit of the problem,
because Graham's intent is for you to use a closure and a lambda (a.k.a anonymous function),
which Java of course has neither of, so we do it with an object.
Nevertheless, I think this is worth having to compare Object-Oriented vs. Functional styles.
