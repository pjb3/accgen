This is a collection of implementations of [Paul Graham's Accumulator Generator][accgen]. The problem is:

> The problem: Write a function foo that takes a number n and returns a function that takes a number i, and returns n incremented by i.
>
> Note: (a) that's number, not integer, (b) that's incremented by, not plus.
